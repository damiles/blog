<p>A loft of times some people send me project with subversion, and when you Â upload to production, sometime you don't want upload .svn folder, looking for in google i found this. A good miracle command for me XD, and sure a stupid command for a lot of people.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">rsync -r --exclude=.svn /home/user/progname/ /home/user/progname.copy</span></p>
