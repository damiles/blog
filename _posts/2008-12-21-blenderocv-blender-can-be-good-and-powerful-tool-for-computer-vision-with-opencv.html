<p>This is the question: can be Blender a powerful tool for computer vision with OpenCv.</p>
<p>Blender is now a powerful suite of 3d content creation, where have a various characteristich as animation, composit, shade, model, texture, interactive ... And OpenCV is ga powerful realtime library for computer Vision.</p>
<p>Then my goal is provide a new and powerfull tool based on Blender for Computer Vision Tasks with OpenCV Library.</p>
<p>How?, with a particular characteristic of Blender, the compositor node.</p>
<p>Nodes are a good tool that provide a user interactive, each node is a box with inputs and outputs that implement a function. Each node have interactive parameters that user can be set.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Each node can be linked with others nodes linking outputs to inputs</p>
<p>In this <a href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-242/blender-composite-nodes/" rel="nofollow">page</a> we can see more about node compositor</p>
<p>With this properties we can create a workflow of a computer vision tasks.</p>
<p>For example here are the basic edge detection with blenderocv, this example implement the basic opencv sample "edge.c"</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_117" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Blenderocv - edge (canny)"]<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2008/12/screenshot.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-117 " title="edge_blenderocv" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2008/12/screenshot-300x177.jpg" alt="Blenderocv - edge (canny)" width="300" height="177" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now there are a demo with some few functions.</p>
<p>I have to implement a lot of functions as nodes, and now there are a lot of work to do, and sure i make important decisions in development. If anybody want colaborate with this project, please send me mail (david at artresnet dot com) or send me a comment.</p>
<p>There are more info and progress about this project in <a title="blenderocv" href="http://code.google.com/p/blenderocv/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/blenderocv/</a></p>
