<p>In this tutorial i go to explain how to image segmentation or detect objects byred color, in this case by red color.</p>
<p>This task is simple, but there are some things we must known.</p>
<p>Now i go to explain and get a demo code for segmentation, how to determine if each image pixel is red or no, and then, i go to explain how we  can detect object, it's similar but with diferent concept.<!--more--></p>

<p>In first moment, we can decide get the red channel of image  and get the values, if it's a higher value then we have a red pixel otherwise no.</p>
<p>This is incorrect. Why?, imagine we have a pixel and in his red channel have a 255 value, this is the higher value, then we decide this is a red pixel, but if in green and blue channel have 255 value too then we have a white pixel instead a red pixel. Then how we determine if a pixel is red or no?</p>
<p>Ok, we go to get some color values and determine how we decide if is red or no.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/colors.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206" title="colors" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/colors.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>Then we can decide that higher red value, and  lower values of blue and green can be defined as red color. Moreover the green and blue values don't have a higher difference between his values.</p>
<p>We go to construct simple graph with some values to see better.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/histo_colors.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-207" title="histo_colors" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/histo_colors.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>We see in this graph that the red value is higher than a max value and there are a min value for green and blue.</p>
<p>The min and max we go to name as blue green threshold and red threshold (bg_threshold, r_threshold).</p>
<p>This code compute for each pixel if it's red or no, and create a black/white image, this is our segmentation image, and with this image we can use to label each object, we use a cvFindContours to retreive the contours of each object detected on our image.</p>

{% highlight c++ %}
for (y = 0; yheight; y++) {
    red = ((uchar*)(img->imageData + img->widthStep * y))[x * 3 + 2];
    green = ((uchar*)(img->imageData + img->widthStep * y))[x * 3 + 1];
    blue = ((uchar*)(img->imageData + img->widthStep * y))[x * 3];
    uchar* temp_ptr = &((uchar*)(img_result_threshold->imageData + img_result_threshold->widthStep * y))[x];

    if ((red > threshold) && (green < BG_threshold) && (blue < BG_threshold) && (abs(green - blue) < BG_diff)) {
        temp_ptr[0] = 255; //White to greater of threshold
    }
    else {
        temp_ptr[0] = 0; //Black other
    }
}

cvMorphologyEx(img_result_threshold, img_morph, img_temp, NULL, CV_MOP_CLOSE, 6);

cvNamedWindow("Threshold", 1);
cvShowImage("Threshold", img_morph);

cvFindContours(img_morph, storage, &contour, sizeof(CvContour), CV_RETR_CCOMP, CV_CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE, cvPoint(0, 0));

for (; contour != 0; contour = contour->h_next) {
    CvScalar color = CV_RGB(rand() & 255, rand() & 255, rand() & 255);
    cvDrawContours(img, contour, color, color, -1, 3, 8, cvPoint(0, 0));
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And this is the result, whe can see in the image a color border with detected red objects, the system detect two objects. The notebook and the notebook corner</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/captura.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-217" title="captura" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/captura-300x156.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>
<p>This is perfect to image segmentation by color, but imagine we have objects ofone image, and we want get each object and know if this object have a predominant red color or no.</p>
<p>The theory is same but applied to the object histogram, and use the median to determine the thresholds</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/histo_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-218" title="histo_1" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/histo_1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="143" /></a></p>
<p>But with this we don't have enough, because we can get a gray image as we can see in the second histogram, then we need use another parameter more, the dispersion of each channel.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/histo_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219" title="histo_2" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2010/01/histo_2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>We can see that in this first histogram we can ensure this object have a predominant red, and in the second histogram no.</p>
